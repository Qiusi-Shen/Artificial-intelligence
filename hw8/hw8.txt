1. 
Pr(D=yes|T=yes) >= 0.3:
Pr(D=yes) >= 0.08942
False positive: Pr(T=no|D=yes) >= 0.00596
False negative: Pr(T=yes|D=no) >= 0.002322

1)
The condition are LightSensor=On and DogBarking=No
After setting the posterior values for LightSensor and DogBarking
Using Query mode in Samiam The result is:

ExpectingGuests: No
FamilyHome: No
DogBarking: No
HearableBarking: No
OutdoorLight: On
LightSensor: On
DogBowelTrouble: Yes
DogOutside: Yes
Battery: OK
LightSensorHealth: OK
SoundSensor: Off
SoundSensorHealth: OK

2)
The condition are FamilyHome=Yes and ExpectingGuests=No:
LightSensor: Off
Battery: OK
LightSensorHealth: OK
SoundSensor: Off
SoundSensorHealth: OK

These values were obtained using the same method as 2a.

3) 

Since LightSensor and SoundSensor are d-separated so they are independent given Z.
So the smallest set of variables Z in your network such that the two sensors are independent given Z
Z = {Battery, FamilyHome} 

4) This network is a multiply-connected network.
